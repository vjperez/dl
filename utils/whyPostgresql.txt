 But I’ve used Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, and MySQL during my career. Hands down,
 Postgres has everything you want and more. I’ve been at my current employer for 10
 months and have been transitioning them from MYSQL to Postgres for 4 months. The difference
 is staggering. Some key difference:

1 JSON/JSONB support

2 Array support and functionality

3 CTE and returning clauses

4 Upsert/On Conflict Inserts

5 More robust data types (UUIDs, Booleans, etc.)

6 The ability to make it your own

7 Ability to create procs/funcs in different languages like Python, JavaScript, Perl, etc. 
I’ve been recently doing lots of JS funcs for JSON payloads e.g. parsing, flattening, mapping, 
reducing. These run faster than anything I’ve created in Postgres and are native.

8 Foreign Data Wrappers- huge. Postgres is now serving as a data warehouse of sorts.
 All of our databases from the past 10 years are now in their individual schemas. They are 
joined and queried in Postgres. We were using Python utilizing Pandas to merge and join. One 
proc took 8 minutes, now in Postgres finishes in 3 secs.
